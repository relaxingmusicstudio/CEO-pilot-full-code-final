An AI voice agent answers your phone 24/7, talks to customers naturally, books jobs on your calendar, and even upsells services like AC tune-ups or furnace maintenance. The difference? It costs a fraction of a full-time employee and works every single night, weekend, and holiday."

Miss just one emergency call a week, and you're leaving $50,000+ on the table every year. The real kicker? 80% of people who can't reach you won't bother leaving a voicemail—they'll just call the next HVAC company on Google."
